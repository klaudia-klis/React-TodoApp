# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# React Todo App with TypeScript and API

This is a simple Todo application built using React, TypeScript, and a RESTful API. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks in a user-friendly interface. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of this application.

## Features

- Create new tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Filter tasks by their completion status (All, Active, Completed).
- Data is persisted on a backend API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Todo app up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    cd react-todo-app

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Todo app.
